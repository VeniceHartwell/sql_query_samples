# sql_query_samples
Sample SQL queries for my Data Analysis portfolio.

## Queries in this project include:

## 1. SUBQUERIES
![SUBQUERY SCREENSHOT](https://github.com/VeniceHartwell/sql_query_samples/blob/main/images/SUBQUERIES.png)
SUBQUERIES are used to find more complex solutions to questions where multiple tables are involved. The WHERE clause will filter for specific information, for example filtering by individual countries.

## 2. JOINS CLAUSES
![JOIN SCREENSHOT](https://github.com/VeniceHartwell/sql_query_samples/blob/main/images/JOINS.png)
JOINS are used to connect various databases within a table.

## 3. HAVING
![HAVING SCREENSHOT](https://github.com/VeniceHartwell/sql_query_samples/blob/main/images/HAVING.png)
The HAVING Function is used to filter.

## 4. REGEX
![REGEX SCREENSHOT](https://github.com/VeniceHartwell/sql_query_samples/blob/main/images/REGEX.png)
REGEX is a pattern recognition language used to filter for specific text in data. It looks daunting, but it is a powerful tool. 

More complex regex queries can be found, most commonly, for email lists. The most common example is `SELECT * FROM people WHERE email NOT LIKE '%_@%_.__%'` for filtering out only effective email addresses.

### A full list
of queries made in this project can be found in the SQL file listed above. Other examples include WHERE, LENGTH, GROUP BY, and more.
